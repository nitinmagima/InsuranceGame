## 
Welcome to the **Customize Your Farming Adventure Page**, where you have the power to fine-tune your simulation parameters and customize your farming experience. Here's what you can do:

1. **Adjust Costs and Revenues**:
   - Set the costs for traditional and high-quality seeds.
   - Define the expected revenue from both types of seeds.

2. **Modify Loan Parameters**:
   - Set the interest rate for loans required to purchase high-quality seeds.

3. **Insurance Parameters**:
   - Specify the **insurance payout** amount in case of crop failure.
   - Adjust the **insurance premium** to determine the cost of purchasing insurance.

4. **Reset to Defaults**:
   - Quickly revert all parameters to their original default values using the **Reset to Defaults** button.

Take control of your simulation and create the scenario that suits your farming strategy! üå±üåæ
